# MessageBusLib
C# Publish-Subscribe Message Bus Library

MessageBusLib is a C# pub-sub message bus interface library. At the moment it comes with a wrapper implementation for interfacing to Apache ActiveMQ. In order to run the sample demo you will need to install Apache ActiveMQ. More details can be found at https://inspiredtechnologies.wordpress.com/2017/04/15/c-publish-subscribe-message-bus-library/ 

A rudimentary network reachability monitoring implementation based on this library is described at https://inspiredtechnologies.wordpress.com/2017/04/16/a-network-equipment-monitoring-system/
